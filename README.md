# appstudio-live-reload #

a simple web server with "live-reload" for NSB/AppStudio

[NSB/AppStudio](https://www.nsbasic.com/) is a simple visual IDE to create applications for iOS, Android, Windows, macOS and Linux. These applications are based on Web technologies and may be written in JavaScript or BASIC. Combined with [VoltCloud.io](https://voltcloud.io/), a deployment server which also integrates simple user management and a basic key-value store, AppStudio simplifies the development of applications for multiple independent users.




**NPM users**: please consider the [Github README](https://github.com/rozek/appstudio-live-reload/blob/main/README.md) for the latest description of this package (as updating the docs would otherwise always require a new NPM package version)
